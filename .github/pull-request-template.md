- [ ] New features should include unit tests and documentation
- [ ] The title is a concise [semantic commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g. "fix: Don't error when embed_options are None" or "docs: Remove release notes and fully capture them in GitHub Releases").
- [ ] Add a label so that the PR is included in the automated release notes:
