        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
        - Since Altair is a Python wrapper around the Vega-Lite visualization grammar, [most bugs should be reported directly to Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/issues).
          You can click the Action Button of your Altair chart and "Open in Vega Editor" to create a reproducible Vega-Lite example and see if you get the same error in the Vega Editor.
        - Search for duplicate issues.
        - Use the latest version of Altair.
        - Describe how to reproduce the bug and include the full code and data to reproduce it, ideally using a sample data set from `vega_datasets`.
