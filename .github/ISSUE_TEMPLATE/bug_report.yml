        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
        
        Note that since Altair is a Python wrapper around the Vega-Lite visualization grammar, [most bugs should be reported directly to Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/issues). You can click the `...` Action Button of your Altair chart and "Open in Vega Editor" to create a reproducible Vega-Lite example and see if you get the same error in the Vega Editor.
        
        Please follow these steps to file a bug report that is easy for us to follow up on:
        
          - Search for duplicate issues.
          - Use the latest version of Altair.
          - Describe how to reproduce the bug and include the full code and data to reproduce it, ideally using a sample data set from `vega_datasets`.
